This initiative represents the realization of a shell as a significant achievement in the ALX Africa Software Engineering C code Milestone Project. The Shell Gates, a project undertaken during the initial trimester, serves as a valuable educational tool for comprehending advanced concepts related to the shell program, such as processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling. Functioning as a straightforward UNIX command interpreter, this program mimics the capabilities of the basic shell (sh) and has been exclusively crafted using the C programming language.
